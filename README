sunaku's Vim configuration
==========================

At long last, I have completely switched from jEdit to Vim [1],
and this [2] is the Vim configuration that made it all possible.

Prerequisites:

  Vim 7.2 or newer

Installation:

  # backup
  mv ~/.vim ~/.vim.bak
  mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc.bak

  # install
  git clone git://github.com/sunaku/.vim.git ~/.vim
  ln -s ~/.vim/config.vim ~/.vimrc

  # bundles
  cd ~/.vim
  sh bundle.sh

Bundle management:

  Bundles (also known as "Vim scripts") are installed
  into their own, self-contained subdirectories inside
  the bundle/ directory.  They are dynamically added
  to Vim's runtimepath (at the top of config.vim) so
  that Vim knows about them and loads them normally.

  Installing or upgrading bundles:

    cd ~/.vim
    sh bundle.sh

  Adding bundles from vim.org:

    #
    # XXX is the ID number from URLs such as:
    # http://vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=XXX
    #
    # YYY is the name (your choice) of the bundle
    #
    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    echo 'script_id: XXX' > YYY.get

  Removing bundles from vim.org:

    #
    # YYY is the name (your choice) of the bundle
    #
    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    rm -rf YYY.get YYY/

  Adding bundles from Git repositories:

    #
    # XXX is the URL of the bundle Git repository
    #
    # YYY is the name (your choice) of the bundle
    #
    git submodule add XXX bundle/YYY
    git commit bundle/YYY -m "added bundle YYY"

  Removing bundles from Git repositories:

    #
    # YYY is the name (your choice) of the bundle
    #
    git rm --cached bundle/YYY
    git commit bundle/YYY -m "removed bundle YYY"
