sunaku's Vim configuration
==========================

At long last, I have completely switched from jEdit to Vim,
and this is the Vim configuration that made it all possible.

Dependencies:

  Vim 7.2 or newer

Installation:

  # backup
  mv ~/.vim ~/.vim.bak
  mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc.bak

  # install
  git clone git://github.com/sunaku/.vim.git ~/.vim
  ln -s ~/.vim/config.vim ~/.vimrc

  # install bundles
  cd ~/.vim
  git submodule init
  git submodule update

  # index bundle docs
  cd ~/.vim/bundle
  sh doc.sh

Bundle management:

  Bundles (also known as "Vim scripts") are installed
  into their own, self-contained subdirectories inside
  the bundle/ directory.  They are dynamically added
  to Vim's runtimepath (at the top of config.vim) so
  that Vim knows about them and loads them normally.

  Installing or upgrading bundles:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle/
    ruby get.rb         # install/upgrade
    sh doc.sh           # index helptags

  Adding bundles:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle/
    #
    # XXX is the ID number from URLs such as:
    # http://vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=XXX
    #
    # YYY is the name (your choice) of the bundle
    #
    echo 'script_id: XXX' > YYY.get

  Removing bundles:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle/
    #
    # YYY is the name (your choice) of the bundle
    #
    rm -rf YYY.get YYY/
